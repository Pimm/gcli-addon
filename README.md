gcli-addon
==========

**addon** command for GCLI â€“ install addons from Firefox' command line!

_Imagine_. You install Firefox. You open up the [command line](https://github.com/mozilla/gcli/) and type
    addon install adblock-plus
In a mere two seconds, your Firefox will be equipped with an ad-blocking add-on.

Everyone will be so impressed. Men will want to be you; women will want to be with you. (Except if you're a woman, as in such
case it will probably be the other way around.)
